# Excel Matrix Structural Analysis

The purpose of this project is to learn techniques of solving linear systems and create an object-oriented matrix structural analysis program within Microsoft Excel using VBA and to gain a better understanding of how commercial analysis software works. Excel was chosen as the platform for this project because many structural engineers use it in practice.

## Truss-Solver

The program currently solves truss structures using the direct stiffness method.

## Goal

The ultimate goal is to create a simple structural analysis engine that uses the direct stiffness method to solve plane and space trusses and frames, that can be extended through proper use of object-oriented concepts.

## Desired Features
* Matrix and vector classes (Dense and Sparse)
* Simultaneous equation algorithms (Gaussian Elimination and Cholesky Decomposition)
* Element classes for defining member stiffness matrices
* Structural material library (AASHTO and ASTM)
* Rolled structural shape library (AISC shapes)
* Global stiffness matrix assembly algorithm
* Structural system input
* Analysis output

## VBA Editor Add-In

The VBA editor is notorious for being out of date with its features and not user friendly for larger scale projects with many modules and class modules. The [Rubberduck VBA Add-In](https://github.com/rubberduck-vba/Rubberduck) is recommended to aid in module organization and is required to run the units tests in this project.
